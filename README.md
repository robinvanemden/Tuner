Autocorrelation based Actionscript online Guitar Tuner

Tuner.as - Basic Flash based (Guitar) Tuner class

Based on http://www.psychicorigami.com/2009/01/17/a-5k-java-guitar-tuner/

This Flash based web tuning application simply starts up 
and tries to work out what note is being played. 
It shows a basic slider that moves according to what note is being played 
and indicates how close to that note you are. 
In addition the raw frequency (in hz) is shown, 
as well a chart that shows the autocorrelation function of the input sound. 
A red line is drawn on this chart when a “valid” note is heard 
and indicates the wavelength of the overall frequency.

Optimized for speed.
